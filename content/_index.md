        ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Taha Rashid! 

        Iâ€™m a first-year Software Engineering student at the University of Ottawa, passionate about building innovative tech solutions and constantly pushing my limits. Whether itâ€™s coding new projects, leading teams, or exploring different technologies, Iâ€™m always eager to learn and improve.
      
        Iâ€™m currently developing AnimeTracker, a native iOS app that helps users track anime episode release schedules. This project has been an exciting challenge and a great way to apply SwiftUI, Python, and API integrations to a real-world problem.
