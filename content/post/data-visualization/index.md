# 🌟 Finished the PerfectFit Home Page! 🌟 

{{< toc mobile_only=true is_open=true >}}

![Placeholder for homepage screenshot](#)  

I’m proud to say that I have finished the home page on the website promoting my team’s mock clothes fitting app, **PerfectFit!** 🎉  

It isn’t anything special, but it's something that I can take a good experience away from.  

## Lessons from Teamwork 👥  

Working with a team to build this website, I’ve learned the practical importance of **clear communication** and **setting deadlines** 📅.  

Having regular discussions to understand each teammate’s progress and vision for the site allowed us to develop ideas—such as the clothing viewer page or the scrolling background logos—and set reasonable smaller deadlines to accomplish bigger tasks.  

**Communication helped us align our visions and finish the website before the deadline:  
🗓️ Tuesday, November 12, 2024. ✅**  

## Prioritization & Project Scope 🎯  

Initially, I had bigger plans for the home page, including:  
- ✨ Nicer transitions  
- 📜 Elements that pop in as the user scrolls  

However, this experience taught me the importance of **prioritizing tasks** and knowing when to **cut** ✂️ features to deliver a **satisfactory final product**.  

Focusing on **completing the homepage first** ensured that we had a **polished final version** rather than a half-baked website before the deadline.  

## New Skills & Technologies 💻  

Throughout this project, I:  
✅ Learned how to use **Git** and **GitHub** for collaboration  
✅ Used **Bootstrap** for the navbar and layout  
✅ Gained hands-on experience in **team-based web development**  

I’m already applying these skills as a **Software Engineer** on the **University of Ottawa Supermileage team** 🏎️, and I plan to continue using them for personal projects.

## What’s Next? 🚀  

This project gave me valuable insight into **real-world software engineering**. However, I also want to **improve**:  
- 🔀 **HTML organization & structure** – Next time, I’ll make sure it’s cleaner and easier to navigate.  
- 🎨 **Better animations & transitions** – I need to do more research on this.  
- 🛠️ **New technologies** – I want to use:  
  - **Tailwind CSS** & **SASS** for styling  
  - **React** with **Next.js** to build future projects  

I **plan to fork 🍴 this repository** and (hopefully) turn PerfectFit into a real product in the future! But first, I’ll focus on:  
1. **Building my portfolio site** using the new technologies I want to learn  
2. **Continuing work on my Anime App** to gain more experience in web and app development
