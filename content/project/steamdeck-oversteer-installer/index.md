# 🏎️ Steam Deck Oversteer Installer (OUTDATED) ⚠️

## 🚨 UPDATE (9/21/2024)
This method is now **outdated** as there is an **official Flatpak for Oversteer**. It is recommended to use the Flatpak instead.

## 🎮 Overview
This script was created to provide an easy way to install **Oversteer**, a tool for steering wheel support, on the **Steam Deck**.

## 🛠️ Installation Steps (Deprecated)
If you still wish to use this method, follow these steps:
1. **Right-click** [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheBossT910/steam-deck-oversteer/main/InstallSteamDeckOversteer.desktop) and **save it to your Desktop**.
2. **Execute the file** to install Oversteer on your Steam Deck.

## 🔗 Alternative: Use the Official Flatpak
For the latest and most reliable installation, use the **official Flatpak version** of Oversteer.
