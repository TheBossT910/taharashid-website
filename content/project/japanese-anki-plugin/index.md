# Japanese Verb Transitivity Anki Plugin 🏮

## 📌 Overview
This Anki plugin parses cards and automatically appends the transitivity of Japanese verbs as:
- **Self-Move** (Intransitive) 🏃‍♂️ – The action occurs by itself.
- **Other-Move** (Transitive) 🎯 – The action is performed on an object.

This tool helps learners quickly identify verb transitivity, making sentence comprehension and memorization easier.

## 🎓 Project Background
This plugin was developed as part of my **Grade 12 Computer Engineering final project**. As part of this project, I also:
- Created a presentation on **Anki** and the **problems with the Core 2k/6k deck**.
- Maintained a **daily development journal** tracking progress and challenges.
- Developed a **proof of concept for scraping verb transitivity from Jisho.org using JavaScript**.

## ⚙️ Features
✅ **Automated Verb Transitivity Detection** – Parses Anki cards and classifies verbs as either intransitive or transitive.  
✅ **Efficient Integration** – Works seamlessly with Anki to enhance existing decks.  
✅ **Jisho Scraping Prototype** – Includes a JavaScript proof of concept for web scraping transitivity data.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (for Anki plugin development)
- **JavaScript** (for Jisho.org scraping proof of concept)

## 📜 Future Enhancements
🔹 **Enhance scraping accuracy** – Improve data extraction for edge cases.  
🔹 **Support for more dictionaries** – Expand beyond Jisho.org for better transitivity detection.  
🔹 **Customizable tagging** – Allow users to modify how transitivity labels appear.
