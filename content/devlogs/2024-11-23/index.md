*AnimeTracker*

- Did some more stuff in Figma.
-   Created a "calendar/schedule" mockup

**Low fidelity**
<img src="images/schedule-low-detail.png" alt="schedule low detail" style="max-height: 800px; width: auto">


**High fidelity**
<img src="images/schedule-high-detail.png" alt="schedule high detail" style="max-height: 800px; width: auto">

- Using these designs, I started coding the schedue section of the app!

***
**Schedule card in app**

- Uploaded project repo to Github now! Xcode will now sync with the GitHub repo (I think lol)

**Next time:**
- Make a view with all shows in the schedule, and make it scrollable
- Find a way to add custom fonts
